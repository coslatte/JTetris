# The Game
We are coding this Tetris clone in Java for the willing of learning and practice the language, aswell as having fun building it.

# Challenge
Code the entire game only using native Java components such as `javax.swing` or `java.awt`. We want to build this using non-generated code from tools like **NetBeans** Interface Desing features, we really want to build it _'by hand'_.

# Our team
We are software engineering students who don't know much, but what we know is that we are coding this up!
We really hope the best LMAO. Hope this proyect turns a completely success. Cheers! üç∑
